# Profile Photo Setup Instructions

## 📸 Adding Your Photo to the Portfolio

### Step 1: Save Your Photo
1. **Save the photo you shared** as `profile-photo.jpg` in the `images/` folder
2. **Recommended specs:**
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Size: 500x500px or larger (square aspect ratio preferred)
   - File size: Under 500KB for fast loading
   - High quality, professional appearance

### Step 2: File Location
```
portfolio/
├── images/
│   └── profile-photo.jpg  ← Save your photo here
└── data/
    └── profile.json       ← Already updated with photo path
```

### Step 3: Alternative Photo Sources
If you want to use a different photo later:

1. **Replace the file**: Simply replace `images/profile-photo.jpg` with your new photo
2. **Use a URL**: Update `profile.json` to use an online photo:
   ```json
   "photo": "https://example.com/your-photo.jpg"
   ```
3. **Different filename**: Update the path in `profile.json`:
   ```json
   "photo": "./images/your-custom-name.jpg"
   ```
